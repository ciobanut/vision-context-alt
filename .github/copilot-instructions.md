# Copilot Instructions – WordPress Plugin Architecture

## Objective

Generate code for a WordPress plugin using:

* Strict OOP
* Namespace + PSR-4
* Single Responsibility Principle
* Scalable architecture
* Clear separation of responsibilities
* No procedural logic outside the bootstrap

---

## Mandatory structure

```
my-plugin/
│
├── my-plugin.php (bootstrap only)
├── composer.json
├── src/
│   ├── Core/
│   │   └── Plugin.php
│   │
│   ├── Admin/
│   │   ├── AdminPage.php
│   │   ├── Assets.php
│   │   └── Settings.php
│   │
│   ├── Api/
│   │   ├── AjaxHandler.php
│   │   └── ExternalApi.php
│   │
│   ├── Services/
│   │   └── DataService.php
│   │
│   └── Helpers/
│
└── assets/
```

DO NOT generate code outside this structure.

---

## Architecture rules

### 1️⃣ Clean bootstrap

`my-plugin.php` must:

* Define plugin metadata
* Load Composer autoload
* Initialize only the main class

No hooks here.
No logic here.

---

### 2️⃣ Core Plugin class

* Is the orchestrator
* Initializes modules
* Contains no business logic
* Contains no HTML
* Makes no API requests

---

### 3️⃣ Admin layer

AdminPage:

* Contains only UI
* Only add_menu_page and render
* Contains no business logic

Assets:

* Only enqueue scripts/styles
* Only localize_script

Settings:

* register_setting
* get_option
* validation

---

### 4️⃣ API layer

ExternalApi:

* Only communication with external API
* Only wp_remote_get / wp_remote_post
* Does not use WP hooks
* Does not echo
* Does not send JSON

AjaxHandler:

* Only wp_ajax hooks
* Only nonce validation
* Calls the Service layer
* Sends JSON response

---

### 5️⃣ Service layer

* Contains business logic
* Processes data
* Transforms data
* May use caching
* Contains no HTML
* Contains no hooks

---

## Strict rules

* Each class = one reason to change
* No global functions
* No procedural code
* No mixing HTML and logic
* No direct API calls from AdminPage
* No wp_remote_* calls from AjaxHandler

---

## Namespace

All classes must use:

```
namespace VisionContextAlt\...
```

PSR-4 via Composer.

---

## Dependency Injection

* Do not instantiate in methods if it can be injected.
* Prefer constructor injection.
* Avoid new ExternalApi() inside methods if it can be injected.

---

## Security

* Use nonces for AJAX
* Escape output (esc_html, esc_attr)
* Sanitize input
* Check capability (manage_options)

---

## JS Rules

* JS in assets/js
* No inline JS in PHP
* Communication only via AJAX or REST
* Use data from wp_localize_script

---

## What must NOT be generated

* Procedural code
* Single-file plugin
* HTML mixed with API logic
* Missing namespace
* Missing composer.json
* Hardcoded dependencies

---

## Quality standard

Code must be:

* Easy to test
* Modular
* Extensible
* Clearly separated by layers
* Ready to scale

---

For commit messages, use Conventional Commits v1 (feat, fix, refactor, docs, style, test, chore) + a clear change description. Example: `feat: add new API endpoint for fetching data` or `fix: resolve nonce validation issue in AJAX handler`.
